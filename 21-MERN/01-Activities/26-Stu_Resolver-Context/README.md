# üêõ Profile Page Is Not Displaying the Logged-In User's Data

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

* As a user, I want to see my own thoughts when I visit the profile page.

## Expected Behavior

When a logged-in user visits the `/me` route, they should see the thoughts they created.

## Actual Behavior

The profile page displays a message informing the user they must be logged in to see the content.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

To reproduce the problem, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to `26-Stu_Resolver-Context/Unsolved` from the command line.

2. Run `npm install`, `npm run seed`, and `npm run develop`.

3. Open <localhost:3000/login> in the browser.

4. Log in with the following test credentials, or create your own user and some thoughts:

   {
     "email": "lernantino@techfriends.dev",
     "password": "password10"
   }

5. Navigate to <localhost:3000/me>.

6. The app does not display the thoughts from this user.

* What is the difference between the server-side `QUERY_ME` and `QUERY_SINGLE_USER` query resolvers that would cause one to work and the other to not work?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How could we implement authentication in a React app without using GraphQL?
