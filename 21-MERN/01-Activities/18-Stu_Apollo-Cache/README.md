Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

* As a user, when I submit a new thought, I want that thought to be displayed on the page without reloading it.

## Expected Behavior

When as user submits a new thought through the form, the thought should be automatically added to the page without refreshing the page.

  To reproduce the problem, follow these steps:

1. Run `npm install` and `npm run develop` from the command line at the root of the application's directory.

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in the browser.
