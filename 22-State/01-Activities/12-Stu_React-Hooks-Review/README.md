# üìñ Implement React Hooks

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to use React Hooks to perform an API request inside a React app.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have imported `useState` and `useEffect` into my React App.

* It's done when I have written a method, `getRepoIssues()`, to fetch all GitHub issues for a given repository.

* It's done when I have written a `useEffect` Hook that will invoke `getRepoIssues()` and fetch issues for the React repository on GitHub.

* It's done when the results of the API request are stored in a state variable called `issues`.

* It's done when a list of issues is displayed when a user visits the page.

## üìù Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[React documentation on using the Effect Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)

[MDN Docs on Using Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)

## üí° Hints

How can we use the browser's built-in `fetch()` method to perform the GET request?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can we restrict the `useEffect` Hook to running only once after the component mounts?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
