# 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of useReducer

Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [StudentList](Unsolved/src/components/StudentList.js).

## Setup

Copy the `src` directory from the unsolved folder into `00-practice-app` before you begin.

## 📝 Notes

When is local state being used as opposed to global state in this application?

What do we need to pass to the `dispatch()` function to add a new major? 

Refer to the documentation: 

[React documentation on useReducer hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How does React know what to update if the state has changed?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
