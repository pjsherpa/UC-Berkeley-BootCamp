# ðŸ“– Initialize Projects using Node Package Manager (npm)

* As a developer, I want to be able to keep track of dependencies using `npm`. 

* As a developer, I want to initialize my project and create a `package.json` file.

* As a developer, I want to be able to save packages to my project.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I see the `package.json` file created in the [Unsolved](./Unsolved/) folder.

* It's done when I have installed the `inquirer` version 8.2.4 package successfully and see it listed in the `package.json` file. Since we will be using a specific version of the `inquirer` package you will need to use the `@` symbol to specify which version during installation.

* It's done when I see the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file in the [Unsolved](./Unsolved/) folder.
