# 🏗️ Refactor the Code in bookSeeds.js to Use async and await Instead of Promises

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, all my CRUD commands should still work when querying the database.

* As a developer, my code should be less cluttered with Promises and instead use `async` and `await` for easier readability.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when a book can still be created, updated, and deleted from the database.

* It's done when my `bookSeeds.js` no longer uses Promises and uses `async` and `await`.

## 💡 Hints

How does JavaScript know when a function is asynchronous?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How could you run this seed file from an npm script? How would you work with multiple models in an `index.js` file?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
