# 🏗️ Use Hooks to Hash a Password

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I want to be able to log in with my password.

* As a user, I want to be able to change my password.

* As a user, I want to know that my password is being stored securely.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when `User.init()` includes Hooks to hash the user's password before it is created.

 * It's done when `User.init()` includes Hooks to hash the user's password before it is updated, only if a password is provided in the payload.

## 💡 Hints

* What have you learned about hashing a password, `async` and `await`, and `try...catch`? 

* What are three methods for adding Hooks to your code? How is adding a Hook via `init()` different from the other options?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Hooks are considered **middleware** in programming terms. What are some other examples of middleware used in Node applications?
