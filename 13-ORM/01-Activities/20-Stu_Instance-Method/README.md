# 🏗️ Create a Custom Instance Method

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I want to log in to my account with my password.

* As a developer, I want to allow a user to log in to their account securely so that their password information isn't compromised. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the model includes an instance method.

* It's done when the instance method compares the user's input with the user's hashed password.

## 💡 Hints

What tools does `bcrypt` offer to help us compare user input to a hashed password?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can we DRY up the code using Sequelize's static model methods?
