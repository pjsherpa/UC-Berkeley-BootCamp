# 📖 Implement CRUD Operations Using Mongoose

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to find a single document and update it by using a Mongoose CRUD method.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I use a Mongoose CRUD method to select a single document with the `name` property of `Kids` and update it.

* It is done when the updated document has an updated `name` property value that matches the value provided in the route parameter.

* It is done when only the `name` property has been updated in the document and no other changes have been made.

* It is done when I test the `POST` Route in Insomnia and the updated document is returned.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[Mongoose docs on findOneAndUpdate()](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/tutorials/findoneandupdate.html)

## 💡 Hints

* How can you add an option to your Mongoose CRUD method so that the updated object is returned?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is the difference between `insert()`, `insertMany()`, and `create()`? Why would you use one method over the other?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
