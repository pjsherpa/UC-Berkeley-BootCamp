# 📖 Implement Subdocuments in a Mongoose Schema

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to nest a child document in a parent document.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I define a new schema named `bookSchema` for the subdocument.

* It is done when the `bookSchema` has two properties: `title` and `price`.

* It is done when the `books` subdocument is nested in the parent document.

* It is done when I have created a model named `Library`.

* It is done when I have created an array of three books using the `bookSchema`.

* It is done when I have created a new instance of the `Library` model which includes the `books` subdocument.

* It is done when I test the `GET` route in Insomnia and the subdocuments are nested in the parent document.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[Mongoose docs on subdocuments](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/subdocs.html)

## 💡 Hints

* When is subdocument data saved?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What method can we use to remove a subdocument?
