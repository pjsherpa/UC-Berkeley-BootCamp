# üêõ GET Route Returns Wrong Summary Price Data

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

* As a user, I should be able to see summary statistics for the prices of books in stock.

## Expected Behavior

When I test the `sum-price` GET route in Insomnia, summary statistics for only books that are in stock should be returned.

## Actual Behavior

When I test the `sum-price` GET route in Insomnia, summary statistics for all books are returned.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

Follow these steps to reproduce the problem:

1. Run `npm install` and `npm start` to start the app.

2. Navigate to Insomnia on your local machine and test the `sum-price` GET route.

3. The summary data for all books are being returned. To see a list of all books for comparison, use the `all-books` GET route.

## Assets
