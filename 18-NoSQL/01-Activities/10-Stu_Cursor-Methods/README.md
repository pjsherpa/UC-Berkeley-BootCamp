# 📖 Implement Cursor Methods to Change How Documents Are Returned

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to change the order in which read operations return documents.

* As a developer, I want to omit documents from the list of returned documents and limit the returned number of documents.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when the documents are returned in descending order using MongoDB methods.

* It is done when the results are limited to five documents.

* It is done when documents that contain the largest five numbers are skipped.

* It is done when routes are successfully tested and the results are returned in Insomnia.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

  * [MongoDB docs on Sort](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.sort/)

  * [MongoDB docs on Skip](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.skip/)

  * [MongoDB docs on Limit](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.limit/)

## 💡 Hints

* Does MongoDB store documents in a particular order? What happens if there are duplicate values?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What method can we use to maximize performance and prevent MongoDB from returning more results than required for processing?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
