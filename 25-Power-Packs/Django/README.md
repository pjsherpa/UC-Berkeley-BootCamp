# Python/Django Power Pack

Hello there and welcome to your Python/Django Power Pack. If you're reading this, we'd like to start by saying _congratulations on completing your bootcamp!_ That's incredible. Do you know what else is incredible? Now that you've conquered JavaScript, new languages, like Python, will be significantly easier.

### Why should I learn Python and Django?

Python is one of the most widely used high-level programming languages, with the TIOBE index naming it the 4th most popular out of 100. And with the rise of Big Data, Python can easily be integrated into web applications that need to implemene Machine Learning. Django, its trusy sidekick, is the most popular Python framework out there, used by the likes of Instagram, Spotify, YouTube, and Dropbox! 

Also, the name Python came from Monty Python, so you can't go wrong! 

### How will I learn Python and Django?

Great question! We'll provide you with class recordings, activities to work on throughout your recording, and a homework assignment to complete once you're done with all three lessons. You'll have a homework solution to look through as well, but don't cheat! The exercise of teaching yourself a new language on your own will be a valuable one, and this will help get you started.

## Let's dive in!

We recommend you cover only one lesson per sitting to prevent information overload. But don't wait too long in between lessons! Coding languages are a lot like spoken ones - if you don't use it, you lose it.

### Lesson 1

1. Open up your `Lesson-1` folder and find `PythonDjango-Installation-Instructions.md`.
2. Install Python and Django on your machine.
3. Open `Activities` folder in your text editor of choice.
4. Open [Python/Django Lesson 1](https://codingbootcamp.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=adfa2186-6880-4dae-ae21-a8c50188a7c5) and start coding along!
5. When the instructor announces it's time for an activity, pause the video and work through it solo.
6. Once you've spent the allotted time on the activity, fast forward the video to the activity review.
7. Next, open up the activity solution file and read through the comments to reinforce your understanding.
8. Play the video once more and repeat until the last activity is complete.

### Lesson 2

1. Before you start today's lesson, make sure that you find time to familiarize yourself with the free levels of Code School's [Breaking the Ice with Regex](https://codingbootcamp.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=adfa2186-6880-4dae-ae21-a8c50188a7c5). Django uses regular expressions to define routes, so this will help!
2. Open up your `Lesson-2` folder.
3. Open `Activities` folder in your text editor of choice.
4. Open [Python/Django Lesson 2](https://codingbootcamp.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f9343372-852a-4ef7-bfc4-a8c80001e214) and start coding along!
5. Use the same workflow as Lesson 1 to watch class and work through the activities until the last one is complete.

### Lesson 3

1. Open up your `Lesson-3` folder.
3. Open `Activities` folder in your text editor of choice.
4. Open [Python/Django Lesson 3](https://codingbootcamp.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=2663a2f2-d949-4bf8-aa4d-a8c900f85bf0) and start coding along! (_Note:_ Make sure to start out with `07-Models/Solved` from last class so you have the same starting point as the video.)
5. Use the same workflow as Lesson 1 to watch class and work through the activities until the last one is complete.

### Homework

First off, killer job, you made it! Whether you feel confusion or mastery, you are adding to your developer skill set by practicing the ability to learn new technologies in this rapidly evolving industry. Now it's time to put those skills to use and create a full stack application with, you guessed it, Python and Django.

1. Open your `Homework` folder.
2. Open your `Instructions` folder and follow the README.md inside.
3. Take your time and work on this over 1-2 weeks.
4. Complete the application or spend at least 10 hours trying.


## Finish Line

Still confused? Just think back to how confusing JavaScript was the first time you used it. If you keep practicing, you'll feel comfortable with Python and Django in no time. Now, last steps: 

 1. Congratulate yourself and practice some self care.
 2. You've earned it.
