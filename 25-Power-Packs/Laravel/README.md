# PHP/Laravel Power Pack

Hello there and welcome to your PHP/Laravel Power Pack. If you're reading this, we'd like to start by saying _congratulations on completing your bootcamp!_ That's incredible. Do you know what else is incredible? Now that you've conquered JavaScript, new languages, like PHP, will be significantly easier.

### Why should I learn PHP and Laravel?

As of August 2019, PHP was used as the server side language on 79.1% of the web. Lavarel, it's trusty sidekick, is the most popular free PHP framework in the world as of October 2018.

### How will I learn PHP and Laravel?

Great question! We'll provide you with class recordings, activities to work on throughout your recording, and a homework assignment to complete once you're done with all three lessons. You'll have a homework solution to look through as well, but don't cheat! The exercise of teaching yourself a new language on your own will be a valuable one, and this will help get you started.

## Let's dive in!

We recommend you cover only one lesson per sitting to prevent information overload. But don't wait too long in between lessons! Coding languages are a lot like spoken ones - if you don't use it, you lose it.

### Lesson 1

1. Open up your `Lesson-1` folder and find `PHP-Installation-Instructions.pdf`.
2. Install PHP on your machine.
3. Open `Activities` folder in your text editor of choice.
4. Open [PHP/Laravel Lesson 1](https://codingbootcamp.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=35b8c703-c532-40d7-b692-aa0f00080a47) and start coding along!
5. When the instructor announces it's time for an activity, pause the video and work through it solo.
6. Once you've spent the allotted time on the activity, fast forward the video to the activity review.
7. Next, open up the activity solution file and read through the comments to reinforce your understanding.
8. Play the video once more and repeat until the last activity is complete.

### Lesson 2

1. Open up your `Lesson-2` folder.
3. Open `Activities` folder in your text editor of choice.
4. Open [PHP/Laravel Lesson 2](https://codingbootcamp.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=8e64d05e-f2b0-480a-9c3e-aa11015224ff) and start coding along!
5. Use the same workflow as Lesson 1 to watch class and work through the activities until the last one is complete.

### Lesson 3

1. Open up your `Lesson-3` folder.
3. Open `Activities` folder in your text editor of choice.
4. Open [PHP/Laravel Lesson 3](https://codingbootcamp.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=866c9b80-8131-47ea-94e0-aa12010870ca) and start coding along!
5. Use the same workflow as Lesson 1 to watch class and work through the activities until the last one is complete.

### Homework

First off, killer job, you made it! Whether you feel confusion or mastery, you are adding to your developer skill set by practicing the ability to learn new technologies in this rapidly evolving industry. Now it's time to put those skills to use and create a full stack application with, you guessed it, PHP and Laravel.

1. Open your `Homework` folder.
2. Open your `Instructions` folder and follow the readme.md inside.
3. Take your time and work on this over 1-2 weeks.
4. Complete the application or spend at least 10 hours trying.
5. Open your `Solutions` folder and review the file structure inside. You'll see most of it is boiler plate like your activities throughout the week.
6. Look inside your views, routes, and database files to see how you could customize this boilerplate to meet your application's needs.


## Finish Line

Still confused? Just think back to how confusing JavaScript was the first time you used it. If you keep practicing, you'll feel comfortable with PHP and Laravel in no time. Now, last steps:

 1. Congratulate yourself and practice some self care.
 2. You've earned it.
