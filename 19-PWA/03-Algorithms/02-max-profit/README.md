# Max Profit

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that takes in an array of numbers each representing the price of a stock on a different day. Return the maximum profit that can be made from a single purchase of stock on one day and a single sale on a later day.

## Instructions

* Open [02-max-profit/Unsolved/max-profit.js](./Unsolved/max-profit.js) in your code editor; this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  * In this file, you will write code in the body of the `maxProfit` function to achieve the following:

    * Return an integer representing the maximum profit that can be made off a single purchase and sale of stock.

    * For example, given the following array:

    ```js
    var arr = [1, 6, 7, 9];
    ```

    * The following should be returned since buying when the stock is `1` and selling when the stock is `9` yields `8`:

    ```js
    8;
    ```

    * Given the following array:

    ```js
    var arr = [9, 7, 4, 1];
    ```

    * The following should be returned since the stock decreases every day, there is no possible profit to be made:

    ```js
    0;
    ```

    * Assume the array will only contain non-negative integers.

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [02-max-profit/Unsolved/test.html](./Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red x and an error message.
