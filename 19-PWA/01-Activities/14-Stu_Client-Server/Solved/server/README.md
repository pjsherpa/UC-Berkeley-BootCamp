# Server Directory

The server directory holds the server-side application.

## Root-Level

At the root level is usually the following files:

* package.json (including scripts to run the server)

* server.js file (in our app, we are using a basic Express.js server)

## Routes

* The routes directory holds `get` route used to serve up the `index.html` from the `dist` folder
