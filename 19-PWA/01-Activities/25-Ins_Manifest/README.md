# Instructor Demo: Manifest

In order to turn your application into a proper Progressive Web Application (PWA), you need to have a `manifest.json` file for your application. The `manifest.json` file let's us define basic metadata for our application, which is used to tell your application how to work when installed.

* ðŸ”‘ A `manifest.json` file can have a number of different properties, such as:

  * Icons

  * Page title

  * Description

  * Themes

  * Starting URL

Open the `manifest.json` file, do the following:

* ðŸ”‘ The first two properties are the `name` and `short_name` which do exactly what there name suggests.

```json
"short_name": "Manifest",
"name": "TODOs Manifest Example",
```

* ðŸ”‘ The next property we see is `icons` which allows us to define multiple different sizes of our logo. These icons are used once the application is installed. In order to be installable, you must include a 192px and a 512px icon.

  ```json
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "./assets/images/icon_96x96.png",
      "type": "image/png",
      "sizes": "96x96",
      "purpose": "any maskable"
    },
    {
      "src": "./assets/images/icon_128x128.png",
      "type": "image/png",
      "sizes": "128x128",
      "purpose": "any maskable"
    },
    {
      "src": "./assets/images/icon_192x192.png",
      "type": "image/png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "purpose": "any maskable"
    },
    {
      "src": "./assets/images/icon_512x512.png",
      "type": "image/png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "purpose": "any maskable"
    }
  ],
  ```

* ðŸ”‘ The`orientation` allows us to define which angle our application is viewed in, while the  `display` property allows us to define preferred display mode.

  ```json
  "orientation": "portrait",
  "display": "standalone",
  ```

* ðŸ”‘ Next, we define the where we want our applications starting URL.

  ```json
  "start_url": "./",
  ```

* ðŸ”‘ Finally, we give our application a description and some styling for the boarders of our application.

  ```json
  "description": "Keep track of important tasks!",
  "background_color": "#7eb4e2",
  "theme_color": "#7eb4e2"
  ```

Once we implement a `manifest.json` file for our TODOs application, we should see a download button in our web address bar.

* ðŸ”‘ It's important to remember that we must register a service worker for a `manifest.json` file to work properly!
