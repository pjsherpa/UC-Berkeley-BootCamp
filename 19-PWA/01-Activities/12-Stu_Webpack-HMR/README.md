# 🏗️ Add Webpack Development Server to a Project Using Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to add a `webpack-dev-server` to my project so that I can use Hot Module Replacement (HMR) to update the page without a full page refresh.

* As a developer, I want to learn how to configure `webpack-dev-server` so that it can test my project in a way that allows my work to continue without much downtime.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I have installed `webpack-dev-server` as a `devDependency`.

* It is done when I have a `webpack.config.js` file in my project that includes the `devServer` property.

* It is done when I have added a `hot` property to the `devServer` object in `webpack.config.js` and set its value to `only`.

* It is done when I have added a `dev` command to `package.json` that runs `webpack-dev-server --open`.

* It is done when I have opened `Unsolved/src/js/index.js` and added logic to accept Hot Module Replacement (HMR), as shown in the documentation.

* It is done when I have opened `Unsolved/src/js/header.js` and updated the code so that the header changes to `orange` instead of `blue` on the button click. 

## 📝 Notes

* If you encounter any issues with loading your most recent changes, refresh the page or try again in a private/incognito window. You may have to refresh a few times!

## 💡 Hints

* What other options are available for the `devServer` property?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is another way to run `webpack-dev-server` without needing to add it to our `package.json` file?
