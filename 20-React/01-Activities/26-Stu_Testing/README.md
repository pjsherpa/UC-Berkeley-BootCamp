## Activity

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have run `npm install pretty` inside my practice React app directory.

* It's done when I have imported the necessary components files into `*.test.js`.

* It's done when I create a test to check that each component renders properly on the page.

* It's done when I have created a test to see if each component matches the snapshot.
