2. Copy the `/src` folder from [Unsolved](./Unsolved/) and paste it into [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

## Activity

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to know how to style a React component using built-in options.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have added inline styles to the `Header`, `Navbar`, and `Section` components.

* It's done when I have updated each component so that the rendered page looks like the [inline styled example](Images/02-InlineStyled.png) using only inline styles, and without altering any of the CSS files.
