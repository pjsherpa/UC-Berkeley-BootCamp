# üèóÔ∏è Implement JSX Expressions

## Before We Begin

Before you complete this activity, complete the following steps:

1. Delete the `/src` folder in [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

2. Copy the `/src` folder from [Unsolved](./Unsolved/) and paste it into [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

3. This project uses Bootstrap, so don't forget to import it inside `index.js`:

  `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'`

## Activity

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to use JSX expressions to render variables in my components.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I create the JavaScript variables requested in [JSXVariables.js](../00-practice-app/src/components/JSXVariables.js).

* It's done when I render a `name` variable that will hold my name.

* It's done when I render the number of letters in the `name` variable.

* It's done when I create a variable called `thoughts` that contains a string regarding my thoughts on React.
## üí° Hints

How can we use the [React Docs on JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) to help us while working with JSX?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What other array methods are available to use on the `name` variable?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
