# 🏗️ Implement a Linear Search Algorithm

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to find the position of a value in a set of data.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the search algorithm function can accept an input array and value to find.

* It's done when the search algorithm returns the position of the value we are searching for.

* It's done when the search algorithm returns `-1` to indicate that the value is not in the data set.

## 💡 Hints

How can we run the unit tests to test our algorithm?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is a more efficient search algorithm?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
