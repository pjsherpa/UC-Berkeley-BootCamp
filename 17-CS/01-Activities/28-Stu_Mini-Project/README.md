# Module 17 Mini-Project: Technical Interview Practice (Sorting Algorithms)

In this mini-project, you and a partner will simulate a technical interview by taking turns as the interviewer and job candidate. 

## Roles

* **The Interviewer**: The role of the interviewer is to pose the question, ensure the candidate understands what is expected of them as they work towards a solution, and respond to any questions the candidate has without giving away the answer. 

* **The Candidate**: The role of the candidate is to ensure that the problem stated by the interviewer is clear by asking clarifying questions and stating assumptions, pseudocoding a solution, and then implementing it (if time allows).

## Instructions

* Take turns playing each role and go through each interview question. 

* Spend about 20 minutes on each, allowing time for research of the problem, pseudocoding the solution, implementing the solution, and discussing throughout for clarification.

* The interviewer can use the prompts and solutions laid out for each question in the [Main](./Main) directory.

* The candidate can use the prompts, notes, and workspace for each question in the [Develop](./Develop) directory.

* During each question, allow the candidate to do some research on the question using Google to help outline a solution. The interviewer can spend that time reviewing the solution code and come up with prompts to support the candidate.

* Take this seriously, but don't put too much pressure on yourself to get to an answer! The idea is to be conversational about these questions to help both of you come to a solution that you can understand and explain in an interview setting.
