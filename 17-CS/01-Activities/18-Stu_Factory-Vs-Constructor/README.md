# 🏗️ Refactor the Lesson Class to a Factory Function

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to move away from an inheritance-based approach and start using a composition-based approach so that my application's tree hierarchy is less rigid.

* As a teacher, I want to be able to add a new lesson with a title and description to the collection of lessons I can teach.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the `Lesson` class is a factory function, making the application less rigid in case we decide to add new features.

* It's done when I can call the `information` method on the `Lesson` function and it correctly logs the private variable.

## 💡 Hints
