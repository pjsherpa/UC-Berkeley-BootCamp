# 🏗️ Create a Function to Pass into the Reducer Method That Finds the Average of an Array of Numbers

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a teacher, I want to be able to find the average grade of my entire class.

* As a developer, I want to be able to reuse my `findAverage` function in multiple filter method calls throughout my application so that my code is not being duplicated unnecessarily.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the `findAverage` function correctly calculates the average of an array of numbers.

* It's done when the `findAverage` function is being correctly passed through the `.reduce()` method.

## 💡 Hints

How do you find out how many elements are in an array? 

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What other built-in functions are also higher-order functions?
